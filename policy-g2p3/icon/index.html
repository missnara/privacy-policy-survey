                  The Online Journal is maintained by the Science Association (SA), ADDRESS. <br> <br>


                  SA is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We strive to provide a safe, secure user
                  experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and
                  practices that apply to the Science Association family of websites (also referred to as the "SA
                  websites"),
                  currently including Online Journal, SA Careers, and SA's other publications.
                  It also includes the order forms and member services accessible from those websites. Your data will be
                  stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States. If you access the Online Journal
                  outside the United States, your usage of that site constitutes consent to the transfer of your data
                  out of your country and to the United States. The Online Journal contains links to other websites over
                  which we have no control. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other
                  websites to which you choose to link from the Online Journal. <br> <br>


                  INFORMATION WE COLLECT <br> <br>
                  When you visit the Online Journal there are two types of information you might provide to us: personal
                  information you knowingly choose to disclose and website use information collected by us as you
                  interact with our website. <br> <br>
                  <span class="box tpd-gen tpd-fin">
                     In some areas of the Online Journal, we request or may request that you provide personal information,
                     including your name, address,
                     e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, contact information, billing information, and
                     any other information from which your identity is discernible.
                  </span> <span class="box tpd-gen">
                     In other areas, we collect or may

                     educational degrees, ethnic background, interests, and household income range.
                  </span> Sometimes we collect or
                  may collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on the Online Journal
                  where we collect or may collect personal or combined personal and demographic data are pages where you
                  can sign up to use a service, post a resume, enter a contest, or purchase a product. <br> <br>

                  DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO OTHERS <br> <br>
                  We do not disclose to third parties your personal information, combined personal and demographic
                  information, or information about your use of the Online Journals (such as the areas you visit or the
                  services you access), except as set forth in the following four subparagraphs. <br> <br>
                  1. We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. <span class="box pp-pro">
                     For example we
                     may use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine
                     whether you might be interested in the products or services of a particular third party.
                  </span> <br> <br>
                  2. <span class="box ptp-tra">
                     We may disclose such information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our
                     behalf.
                  </span> Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
                  processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will
                  have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not
                  share that information with any other third party. <br> <br>
                  3. <span class="box ptp-tra">
                     We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a
                     governmental entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to
                     legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of SA; (c) prevent
                     a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
                  </span> <br>
                  <br>4. We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a
                  substantial portion of the Science business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger,
                  consolidation,
                  or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event any one or all of
                  the SA websites become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, the
                  SA or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license, or otherwise dispose of such information in a
                  transaction approved by the bankruptcy court.<span class="box ptp-tra">
                      The SA may also share aggregated anonymous information
                     about visitors to SA websites with its clients, partners, and other third parties so that they may
                     understand the kinds of visitors to the SA websites and how those visitors use the site.
                  </span><br> <br>
                  RESUMES <br> <br>
                  On SA Careers, we give you the option of putting your resume or CV (collectively referred to as
                  "resume") in our database. There are two ways of doing this: <br> <br>
                  <span class="box tpd-gen spd-pro">You can post your resume in our database as either a public or private resume.</span> Public resumes can be
                  searched by parties with access to our searchable resume database. <br> <br>
                  If you allow your resume to be searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume
                  database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. We attempt to limit access to our
                  searchable resume database (or copies thereof) only to paying employers,
                  recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals as well as law enforcement
                  and national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this
                  database. We are not responsible for the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes
                  while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at
                  any time. However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database or to
                  obtain a copy of that database as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may
                  have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the
                  retention,
                  use, or privacy of resumes in these instances. <br> <br>
                  Please Note: It is not our practice to restrict access to our resume database to any particular
                  customer(s). Please be advised that your current employer or an entity affiliated with your current
                  employer might be a customer of the sa-careers.org sites. We are not responsible for any actions or
                  results that may occur as a result of any customer's access to and/or use of your resume. <br> <br>
                  We reserve the right to remove from our database any resumes we consider to be illegal or offensive.

                  ADDITIONAL TERMS AND RULES FOR SOCIAL NETWORKING <br> <br>
                  Social networking services provided on the Online Journal (e.g. the SA Careers Community pages) may
                  have additional terms of conduct, privacy policies, and privacy settings that you will be required to
                  agree to and set when you register for such services. <br> <br>
                  USE OF COOKIES <br>
                  <br><span class="box tpd-gen pp-dev pp-pro"> We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience.</span> A cookie is a text file
                  that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or
                  deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read
                  by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is
                  to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server
                  that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages or register for
                  services on any of the SA websites, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as
                  user name, password, and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more
                  accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the Online Journal, the
                  information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you
                  customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing. <br> <br>
                  You may have the ability to accept or decline all cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
                  cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer.
                  Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
                  tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. It is possible to sign in
                  to any of the SA websites without accepting cookies. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that
                  may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience at the Online Journal. <br> <br>
                  USE OF WEB BEACONS <br> <br>
                  <span class="box tpd-gen pp-dev">
                     Our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel GIFs)
                     that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services.
                  </span>Web
                  beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information on the Online Journal; they
                  are a technique we use to compile aggregated statistics about our Website usage. Web beacons collect
                  only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a
                  description of the page on which the web beacon resides. <br> <br>
                  UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION <br> <br>
                  It is important to us that we have your correct contact information so that you don't miss out on
                  further correspondence or experience problems with the delivery of publications and products. <br>
                  <br>
                  Members can change their personal information or update their account information at any time by
                  linking to http://sa_member.org and selecting Member Services. Other registrants or users may also
                  update their personal information at any time by sending e-mail to membership{at}sa.org. <br>
                  <br>SECURITY <br> <br>
                  We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal
                  information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. In
                  addition, all credit transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss,
                  misuse, or alteration of information collected. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third
                  parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper
                  purposes. When you place an order online at any of the SA websites, your credit card information is
                  protected through the use of encryption utilizing Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, the industry
                  standard in transferring information to process your orders. <br> <br>
                  The SSL encrypts, or translates,
                  your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. When you've
                  finished your transactions and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our
                  site. A warning window may pop up to notify you that you are entering this "safe" area. Once you've
                  entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure
                  area.
                  Also, a key or closed lock will appear in the lower left-hand corner of your screen to notify you of
                  this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process. In addition, only
                  the last four digits of your credit card number will be revealed on the screen when confirming an
                  order. Of course, we securely transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card
                  service company during order processing. <br> <br>
                  CHILDREN <br> <br>
                  The SA websites are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect
                  personal information from children under 13. <br>
