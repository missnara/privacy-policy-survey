                  here's how we manage and use your data. <br> <br>
                  We take protecting your privacy seriously, and we want you to understand exactly how and why we use
                  your information. This document is our Privacy Policy, which describes what information we collect and
                  what it's used for. It applies to all interactions with community-forum.com, including interactions
                  with our site through buttons and widgets. It also applies to community-forum.tv and mobile
                  applications produced by Community Forum.<br> <br>
                  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. Your use of and/or registration with Community Forum will
                  constitute your agreement to our policy. If you cannot agree to the terms and conditions set forth
                  below, please do not use our services. Additionally, our Privacy Policy is part of our User Agreement,

                  <strong> about this policy </strong> <br> <br>
                  Community Forum is an open platform that allows you to communicate about anything you want on any
                  topic you want. We collect some information in order for you to have an account you can use to
                  participate on the site, and other information that is necessary to make the service work.
                  <span class="box ptp-sal-neg">
                     Our goal in developing our privacy practices is to allow your participation to remain as anonymous as
                     you choose, and we dont sell or profit from the information you share with us.
                  </span> <br> <br>
                  We do take efforts to make sure the platform keeps working. This includes using your information,
                  where necessary, to stop spam and gaming and other activities that violate the user agreement. <span class="box ptp-tra">
                     We also
                     share your information when we are legally required to do so.
                  </span> Please read this privacy policy
                  carefully. It describes what information we collect, how it is used, and when it is shared so you can
                  make smart decisions about how you use Community Forum! We think it strikes a good balance and
                  respects you our users who make this whole thing possible. Let us know what you think. <br> <br>

                     When you create an account, you are required to provide a username and password, and may opt to
                     provide an email address. We also log,

                     Post, Comment and Messaging Data </strong> <br> <br>
                  The posts and comments you make on Community Forum are not private, even if made to a sub-community
                  not readily accessible to the public. This means that, by default, they are not deleted from our
                  servers ever and will still be accessible after your account is deleted. However, we only save the
                  most recent version of comments and posts, so your previous edits, once overwritten, are no longer
                  available. <br> <br>
                  Your messages are generally only viewable by the parties involved, but they may be accessed internally
                  as needed for community support. Moreover,
                  we keep a complete log of all messages sent on our service, even when both parties later delete their
                  accounts. <br> <br>
                  <span class="box tpd-gen">
                     Community Forum stores the IP addresses associated with specific posts, comments,
                     and private messages for 90 days after they are made or sent.

                  with the transaction number associated with the payment and the recipient of any gold you send.
                  Although Stripe and PayPal send us a receipt with your name and email address if you provide it, we
                  don't add that information to your account. <span class="box tpd-fin-neg">
                     However, Community Forum does not handle or have access to

                  <strong> our use of your information is limited to improving your experience </strong> <br> <br>
                  It takes a lot of work to keep our site running and prevent abuse, and we sometimes use your data in

                     services.

                  track and block suspected spammers, and otherwise maintain the integrity of the community. <br> <br>
                  <strong> your private information is never for sale </strong> <br> <br>
                  This means that we will only share your personal data with your consent, and after letting you know

                     authentication cookies </strong> <br> <br>
                  When you log into your account, Community Forum will place a cookie for the sole purpose of creating
                  this session. It contains your user id and hashed authentication information. <br> <br>
                  <strong> analytics cookies </strong> <br> <br>
                  We use a tool called Google Analytics to help us understand how users interact with our website. It
                  tells us aggregate usage and traffic information, such as how the site was accessed, how long visitors
                  stayed, and the number of first-time visitors to the site. To learn more about Google Analytics and
                  how it uses your data, please visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html. <br> <br>
                  We also place our own session cookie, which contains the date the cookie was set and a unique
                  identifier. This data is anonymized, never associated with your Community Forum account (whether you
                  are logged-in or not), and follows the requirements laid out in the What Information We Collect
                  section of this policy. By knowing how people use the site, we can make it better. <br> <br>
                  <strong> pixel data </strong> <br> <br>
                  We use small image files called web pixels to collect activity information to help understand how
                  people use the service so we can make it better. We use this information internally only, and we
                  remove information that could be used to identify an individual user after 90 days. <span class="box">
                     We only link this
                     information to your Community Forum account when you are signed in.

                  <strong> disabling cookies </strong> <br>
                  <br> Most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones. However, if you do
                  this, portions of the Community Forum website may not function as intended. <br> <br>
                  <strong> content delivery cookie </strong> <br> <br>
                  The company that delivers the Community Forum website to your computer, CloudFlare, may place a cookie
                  on your computer as part of the service it provides, which includes monitoring visitors IP addresses
                  to track malicious actors. Further information regarding this cookie can be found in CloudFlare's
                  Security Policy. <br> <br>
                  <strong> advertising </strong> <br> <br>

                  We partner with Adzerk to show our users third party banner ads and to provide self-serve, or
                  sponsored headline, ads you see near the top of Community Forum pages. <br> <br>
                  Some cookies may be placed during the provision of this service pursuant to Adzerk's privacy policy.
                  <br> <br>
                  To make our ads relevant to you, Adzerk receives information about the page the ad will appear on.
                  This information includes the sub-communities used to generate that page (which may include your
                  subscriptions), as well as your IP address from which your general location (your country or city
                  area) can be inferred. Keep in mind that when you comment and interact with a sponsored headline,
                  others who view that same ad may be able to infer basic information about the location of your
                  computer (since some ads like for a music venue in San Francisco are only seen in some geographies).

                  <strong> account deletion
                  </strong> <br> <br>
                  You may choose to delete your Community Forum account at any time. The usernames associated with
                  deleted accounts remain unavailable for others to use, and your public profile is no longer visible to
                  Community Forum users. However, the posts and content you made during your tenure as a Community Forum
                  user will not be automatically deleted as part of the account removal process, though your username
                  will be publicly disassociated with all posts. Also, we do not have control over third parties that
                  may collect and store data independently from Community Forum without our permission and without
                  following our rules. <br> <br>
                  <strong> third party sites </strong> <br> <br>
                  Certain third party sites may offer users the option to log in using their Community Forum id. This
                  option is only an authentication tool and does not transmit any new personal information to or from
                  Community Forum, or give Community Forum access to details of subsequent actions taken on these sites.

                  <strong>
                     email communications </strong> <br> <br>
                  When you contact Community Forum support or subscribe to one of our email newsletters, Community Forum
                  may use a third party service to send you email messages. All of our email communications are opt-in
                  only. If you do opt into one of our subscription emails, only your email address will be stored with
                  the third party service. We will always make it easy to opt out of our subscription emails, for
                  example, by including a 1-click unsubscribe link. <br> <br>
                  <strong> data security </strong> <br> <br>
                  Community Forum will make every effort to secure any private information submitted to us by our users.
                  We also maintain internal security practices designed to keep your data secure and private. As part of
                  this, we limit employee access to user data. However, no data transmission over the internet is
                  completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the service at
                  your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as
                  carefully maintaining the secrecy of your password). <br> <br>
                  <strong> international visitors </strong> <br> <br>
                  Community Forum is a San Francisco, California-based company whose servers are housed in the United

                  of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Community Forum has
                  certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer,

                  with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact us. <br> <br>
                  Community Forum has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Safe Harbor
                  Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the
                  Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or

                  <strong> children under 13 </strong> <br> <br>

                  Although we welcome users from all walks of life, Community Forum is not aimed at children, and the
                  United States government has put limits on our ability to accept users under a certain age through the
                  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Individuals under the age of 13 may not create an
                  account with us. If you believe someone 12 or younger is using our site without parental consent,
                  please contact us. <br> <br>
                  <strong> involuntary pornography </strong> <br> <br>
                  Community Forum is committed to your privacy. If you believe that someone has submitted, without your
                  permission, to Community Forum a link to a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of
                  nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, please contact us ( contact@community-forum.com), and
                  we will expedite its removal as quickly as possible. Community Forum prohibits the posting of such
                  content without consent. <br> <br>

                  Community Forums mobile apps provide a unique and convenient way to experience Community Forum. This
