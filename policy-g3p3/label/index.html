                     that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users
                     personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the

                     personally identifiable information while on our site. We use both session ID cookies [and]
                     persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply
                     terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an
                     extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file
                     directions. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">We use cookies to enhance the Science

                     use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site.
                     For example, the user will not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or
                     monthly drawings that take place. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of
                     our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the 'Profile' section. <br> <br></span><span

                     class="box FPCU-box">Log Files <br> <br> Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This

                     referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends,
                     administer the site, track user?s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic
                     information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable
                     information We use a tracking utility called ClickTracks that uses log files to analyze user
                     movement. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) <br> <br> We
                     employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better
                     manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics
                     with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online
                     movements of Web users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible on the
                     page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are
                     not tied to users? personally identifiable information. <br> <br></span>Clear Gifs can "work with"
                  existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That
                  means, for example, that if a person visited 'www.companyX.com', which uses an advertising company's
                  clear gif, the Web would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID
                  number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. <br> <br><span class="box FPCU-box">In
                     addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened
                     by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the
                     effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please
                     see the Opt-out section. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box UCC-box"><strong> Communications
                        from the Site </strong> <br> <br> Special Offers and Updates <br> <br> We send all new members a
                     welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive
                     information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy
                     of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the
                     Choice and Opt-out sections. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">Newsletter <br> <br> If a
                     user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email
                     address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications.

                     Announcements <br> <br> On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related
                     announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send
                     users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can
                     deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. <br>
                     <br></span>Customer Service <br> <br> We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide
                  requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in

                     <br> Legal Disclaimer <br> <br> Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need
                     to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such
                     action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process
                     served on our Web site. <br> <br></span><span class="box TPSC-box">Aggregate Information
                     (non-personally identifiable) <br> <br> We share aggregated demographic information with our
                     partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box TPSC-box">These are the instances in which we will share users personal

                     goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable
                     information for any secondary purposes. <br> <br></span><span class="box TPSC-box PC-box">Business
                     Transitions <br> <br> In the event Science Magazine, Inc. goes through a business transition, such
                     as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal
                     information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via
                     email prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of
                     the business transition, the users? personally identifiable information will be used in a manner
                     different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our

                     Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not
                     directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order form
                     has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing
                     material, can keep their email address off of our lists. <br> <br></span><span

                     communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the

                  information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed

                     completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
                     information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and
                     shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used
                     to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous Survey information will be used for purposes of

                     registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number
                     and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best
                     encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock
                     icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
                     becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box DS-box">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
                     online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
                     information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only
                     employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a
                     customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our
                     employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return,
                     they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, all employees
                     are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new
                     policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on
                     privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers
                     that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in
                     a locked facility. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">Supplementation of Information <br>
                     <br> In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us
                     to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box UAED-box">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal
                     Information <br> <br> If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code,
                     phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to
                     correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can usually
                     be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box PC-box">Notification of Changes <br> <br> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we
                     will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem
                     appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
                     what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy
                     policy under which the information was collected. <br> <br></span><span class="box PC-box">If,
                     however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from
                     that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as
                     to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted
                     out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be
                     contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make
                     any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in
                     our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In
                     some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive
                     communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. <br>
