               <div id="p1"><strong> Broadcasting Service (BS) </strong><br> <br>BS is committed to protecting the private
                  information of our web site visitors. From the bs.org homepage to more than 150,000 pages of content
                  produced by our affiliates, the "bs.org" domain remains a safe haven. The bs.org web site adheres to a
                  strict policy for ensuring the privacy of personally identifiable information and preserving the
                  integrity of this online medium. Here we explain the type of information collected from bs.org, how
                  that information may be used, how you can access or modify that information, and how that information
                  is protected. <br> <br>I. WHICH SITES ARE COVERED BY THIS POLICY- <br> <br> This Privacy Policy
                  applies to bs.org ("Site"). Please note that our Site may contain links to sponsor organizations and
                  BS Local Stations. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those web sites. We encourage
                  you to review the privacy policy of any organization before submitting your personal information to
                  them. <br> <br><span class="box FPCU-box">II. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER- <br> <br> BS collects two
                     types of information from visitors to the Site: (A) Personally Identifiable Information, and (B)
                     Non-personally Identifiable Information (information such as IP Addresses and cookies, which allow
                     for a better use of the Site). Uses of this information are discussed in Section III. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box UCC-box">A. Personally Identifiable Information <br> <br> BS
                     will not collect personally identifiable information from you, other than what you supply to us on
                     a voluntary basis upon request. Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited
                     to, name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card information. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">Registration for our website : <br> <br> Our Site may at
                     times require a free registration, which enables full access to the information and resources
                     offered on our Site. A unique email address must be supplied to register. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box FPCU-box">Paid Products and Services : <br> <br> While the majority of our Site is free,
                     we may charge fees for select products and services. To enable the purchase of these and other
                     products, we collect your telephone number, e-mail address, billing address and credit card
                     information. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box DR-box">Support of Local Stations and other
                     public broadcasting entities : <br> <br> On certain pages within the Site, BS may offer visitors
                     the opportunity to make a donation in support of public broadcasting entities, programs and series,
                     or to order products, subscriptions or other services offered by BS Local Stations. If a visitor
                     chooses to make a donation or order such other products or services, BS will collect and store your
                     telephone number, e-mail address, billing address and credit card information. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">Forums, Feedback and Content Submissions : <br> <br> On some
                     pages of the Site, you can submit content to be published, make community postings, comments,
                     suggestions, and vote. We may collect name, address, and e-mail addresses in connection with these
                     activities. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box UCC-box">Your submission of others'
                     Personally Identifiable Information : <br> <br> On some pages of the Site, you can submit
                     information about other people. For example, you may submit a person's name and email address to
                     send an article. Additionally, you may purchase a gift online and submit the person's name, address
                     and telephone number for delivery. This information will only be used for the stated purpose. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers : <br> <br> On
                     occasion, we may collect personal information from users in connection with optional (i.e., you
                     opt-in to participate in these offers) sweepstakes, contests or special offers. Such information
                     will be used as indicated at the time of collection. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box FPCU-box">Listservs and E-mail Newsletters: <br> <br> On occasion, we may collect
                     personal information from users in connection with optional (i.e. you opt-in to subscribe to these
                     services) listservs and e-mail newsletters. Such information will be used as indicated at the time
                     of collection. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box DR-box"><strong> B. Non-personally
                        Identifiable Information </strong> <br> <br> In addition to information that you provide to us,
                     we may also collect and store certain non-personally identifiable information automatically when
                     using the Site. This information helps us improve the experience you and other visitors have with
                     the Site. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">For example, we may collect your IP address,
                     browser information and reference site domain, as well as related information such as the date on
                     which you visit the Site. This information does not identify you personally and is only used in the
                     aggregate. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">As is common practice among web sites, we use
                     "cookies" and similar technologies. Cookies are text files which store your preferences. No
                     personal information is ever stored in a BS cookie, even if you have entered your name or email
                     address on other parts of the Site. <br> <br></span><span class="box UCC-box">You can generally
                     prevent cookies from being used by changing the settings in your web browser, but please be aware
                     that by doing so you may be unable to fully utilize the Site. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box TPSC-box">III. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION GATHERED ON THE SITE- <br> <br> Except as
                     expressly set forth in our policies, we will not willfully disclose your personally identifiable
                     information to any third party without first receiving your permission. We will never sell, rent,
                     or swap your personally identifiable information with non-affiliated third parties for their own
                     purposes. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">In terms of our own use of information, we may
                     use your personally identifiable information for the activities described in the previous sections,
                     and for internal purposes and marketing, promotional and fundraising purposes in support of public
                     broadcasting. <br> <br></span><span class="box UCC-box">We will typically explain the extent of use
                     at the time you are asked to provide personal information. If you do not want this information to
                     be collected or used by us for these purposes, you can simply "opt out." Under certain
                     circumstances, opting out may prevent your participation in activities for which personal
                     information is needed, as in contests. <br> <br></span><span class="box TPSC-box">In certain cases,
                     we contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf. These service providers may
                     maintain customer databases which may hold Site users' e-mail addresses, including: <br> <br>
                     viewers, listeners and members; <br> Site visitors who have provided them to BS by registering at
                     our Site or signing up for a newsletter or listserv; <br> audience members who e-mail questions
                     about membership or programs; <br> donors who submit online contributions; or <br> online buyers
                     who make a purchase. <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">We (which includes our service
                     providers) will use these addresses to respond to the general purposes for which we collected the
                     information, to provide services and to operate the Site, including to respond to inquiries, to
                     process credit card payments and billing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing and
                     analysis, promotions management, to send information about BS programs, Site, services, membership
                     or to correspond about a purchase or product offers. For example, shopbs.org uses a third party
                     fulfillment agent to manage orders, credit card processing, order fulfillment and shipping, and
                     related tasks. <br> <br></span><span class="box TPSC-box DS-box">Our service providers have access
                     to your personally identifiable information as necessary to provide certain services on our behalf.
                     They are required to maintain the privacy of all such information in their possession or control
                     and can only use the information on our behalf for the purpose that we have contracted them, for
                     example processing your order or sending you a series newsletter. They are not authorized to use
                     your information for any other purpose. <br> <br></span><span class="box TPSC-box">Similarly,
                     personally identifiable information provided in connection with a donation intended for a program,
                     series or Local Station, or for purposes of ordering products, subscriptions or other services
                     offered by the BS Local Stations, will be shared by BS or by such BS Local Stations with third
                     parties who perform services to process the donation or the applicable order. Also, in transmitting
                     your donation or order to the local Local Station BS may share your personally identifiable
                     information with the Local Station for order or donation processing. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box TPSC-box UCC-box">At times, we make customer mailing lists available to carefully
                     screened companies whose products or services might interest individuals who have shopped on the
                     Site. <strong> If you prefer that we not share your information in this way, please contact us.
                     </strong> <br> <br></span><span class="box TPSC-box">We, or our service providers, may release
                     personal identification information if we believe in good faith that the law or legal process
                     requires it, we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency, or such
                     release is necessary to protect anyone's rights, property or safety. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box TPSC-box">On certain pages, we offer visitors the opportunity to provide comments or
                     other user-generated content on blogs and articles. Any information that you disclose when posting
                     a message to these areas, along with the screen name or ID used, becomes public. In addition, the
                     information that you disclose in these areas may be used by us for promotional and marketing
                     purposes. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to
                     disclose in these public areas. <br> <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">We reserve the right to
                     send you e-mail relating to your account status. This includes order confirmations,
                     renewal/expiration notices, notices of credit card problems, other transactional e-mails and
                     notifications about major changes to our Site. If you have registered for online discussions or
                     other services, you may receive e-mail specific to your participation in those activities. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box UCC-box">We offer several e-mail newsletters and listservs. If you no
                     longer wish to receive a specific newsletter, you may opt out by following the "unsubscribe"
                     instructions located near the bottom of each newsletter. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box FPCU-box">We use non-personally identifiable information, such as IP addresses or
                     demographic information (zip codes for example) to tailor our Site to the interests/locations of
                     our users and to measure traffic within our Site. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box FPCU-box UCC-box">BS uses the content from the cookies to deliver relevant local
                     resources, remember browser preferences, and improve our visitors' experiences on the Site. BS does
                     not sell information collected by cookies nor use the information for commerce-related purposes. In
                     addition, BS will not filter content based on your preferences without permission. <br>
                     <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box">BS uses cookies at the following times: <br> <br> A cookie
                     may automatically localize bs.org to the BS station nearest you. You can choose to have your
                     computer remember a different station or no station at all at any time. <br> If you watch a video
                     clip or listen to an audio clip on bs.org, a cookie may remember which media player and type of
                     clip you prefer to use on your computer. You can change your video and audio preferences at any
                     time, or choose a player each time you view of listen to a clip. <br> A cookie will tell us which
                     pages you visit and the amount of time between each page visit. The cookie does not remember any
                     information about you or your computer; it just helps us at BS monitor Site usage and traffic; for
                     example, it allows us to measure the number of repeat visitors to bs.org in a given month. This
                     data is only used in the aggregate. <br></span><span class="box FPCU-box TPSC-box">Additionally,
                     cookies may be used on pay sites to (1) identify the terms of any special offers you may have
                     obtained, such as price discount or free trial period AND/OR (2) automatically sign you in so that
                     you do not have to enter a username and password each time you visit. <br> <br></span><span
                     class="box UAED-box UCC-box">IV. HOW CAN I ACCESS OR CORRECT INFORMATION- <br> <br> Access to
                     personally identifiable information that is collected from our Site may be accessible for a limited
                     period of time from the point of collection, such as where a user provides an e-mail address in
                     order to receive an e-mail newsletter or a reminder about an upcoming program or event. In other
                     cases, personally identifiable information may be maintained, edited and deleted at the user's
                     discretion at any time after the information has been submitted to BS. For example, if you created
                     a password-protected account within our Site, you may be able to access that account to review the
                     information you provided and make corrections and updates as necessary. However this feature is not
                     available throughout our Site where the user is not asked to create an account. Therefore, if at
                     any time, you prefer not to receive e-mail from a service that you subscribed to without creating a
                     personal account, simply get out by following the unsubscribe options at the bottom of each e-mail.
                     <br> <br></span>You may also send an e-mail or letter to the following e-mail or street address
                  requesting access to or correction of your personally identifiable information. For verification
                  purposes please include your first name, last name, e-mail address and the password you use for said
