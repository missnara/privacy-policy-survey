                  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of
                  13 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has

                  <br><strong> Your California Privacy Rights. </strong> <br> <br>

                  (a) California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain
                  information regarding our disclosure, if any,
                  of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in
                  the preceding calendar year. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own
                  direct marketing purposes. (b) California residents who are registered users of the Services and are

                  <strong> Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. </strong> <br> <br>

                  Some web browsers may transmit do-not-track signals to the websites with which the user communicates.
                  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always
                  clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of
                  them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do
                  when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these
                  signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to
                  these signals. In the meantime,
                  please see Online Tracking & Advertising for additional information about privacy choices that may be
                  available to you with respect to targeted advertising. <br> <br>

                  <strong> International Transfers.

                  to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be collected in your country and
                  subsequently transferred to the United States or to another country in accordance with applicable law.
                  By using the Services, you consent to the collection, international transfer,
                  storage, and processing of your information <br> <br>

                  here, or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the
                  updated policy is posted on the Services. Your use of the Services or your provision of personal
                  information to use the Services following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised

                      We and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality on our Services, may use

                     to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and improve the advertising shown to you

                  <strong> Cookies.
                  </strong> <br> <br>

                  Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website.
                  Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that
                  you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more
                  sites.
                  Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example: <br> <br>


                  <ul>
                     <li> Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials
                        each time you visit a Service
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                     <li> Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most
                        popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they
                        spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our
                        Services and provide you with a better experience.
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                     <li> Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you dont receive
                        the same ad each time you access a Service.
                  </ul>
                  </li>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the
                  user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to

                  <strong> Beacons. </strong> <br> <br>

                  We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or pixels) that communicate
                  information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and
                  emails, and can allow a
                  server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular
                  content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and
                  the IP address of your device. <span class="box pp-pro">
                     We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including
                     to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that
                     are more relevant to you.
                  </span> <br> <br>

                  <strong> Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. </strong> <br>
                  <br> We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects
                  (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These
                  technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can
                  be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these
                  technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might
                  not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the
                  method for disabling HTML5
                  will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting
                  information contained in Flash cookies can be found here. <br> <br>

                  <strong> Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising </strong> <br> <br>

                  <span class="box pp-mar pp-pro">
                     As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate
                     serving relevant ads to you.
                  </span> For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a
                  particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid
                  sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising
                  by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page. <br> <br>

                  In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out
