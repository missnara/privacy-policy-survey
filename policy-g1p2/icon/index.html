                        your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as

                        from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or
                        how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by
                        browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web
                        site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of
                        Movie Archive's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.

                           We
                           also allow third parties to place web beacons and other technologies on our site to conduct

                     Information
                     about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to
                     others.
                  </span> We share user information with our parent corporation (Retail.com, Inc.), the subsidiaries it
                  controls, and as described below. <br> <br><strong> Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control :
                  </strong> <span class="box ptp-tra pp-mar">
                     We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, we will include offerings
                     from these businesses on Movie Archive. In other cases, we may include joint offerings from Movie
                     Archive and these businesses on Movie Archive. You can tell when another business is involved in the
                     offering, and we share user information related to those offerings with that business.
                  </span> <br>
                  <br><strong> Agents : </strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
                  behalf. Examples include sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing
                  data, and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed to perform
                  their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. <br> <br><strong> Promotional Offers :
                  </strong> Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of Movie Archive users on behalf of other
                  businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and e-mail address. If you do not
                  want to receive such offers, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. <br>
                  <br><strong> Business Transfers : </strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or
                  buy additional services or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is
                  transferred along with the rest of the service or business unit. Also, in the event that Movie
                  Archive, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be
                  included in the transaction. <br> <br><strong> Protection of Movie Archive and Others : </strong> <span class="box ptp-tra">
                     We
                     release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with
                     law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights,
                     property, or safety of Movie Archive, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with
                     other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

                     Advertisers- </strong> <br> <br> Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other
                  websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or
                  third-party websites. <br> <br>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising
                  companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements
                  that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when
                  this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or
                  single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to
                  personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features
                  that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not
                  covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy
                  practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet
                  advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information
                  about how to opt-out of their information collection. <br> <br><span class="box pp-mar">

                     Although Movie Archive does not provide any personal information
                     to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with
                     or click on a personalized advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users
                     in the northwestern United States who bought, watched, or browsed for romantic comedies).
