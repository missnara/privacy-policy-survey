                  <br> Clothing Store values your time, respects your privacy, and seeks to earn your trust. <br> <br>

                  <span class="box pp-dev">
                     We collect information about you in our stores and through the Sites ( clothing-store.com,

                      As described in
                     this policy, we may share your information among our brands and, under certain circumstances, with

                  What kind of personal information does Clothing Store collect- <br> <br>

                  <span class="box tpd-gen spd-col tpd-fin spd-pro">
                     We may collect personal information from you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone
                     number,
                     purchase history, credit card number, gender, birthday, and personal interests, when you visit one of

                    <span class="box spd-col">
                     We may occasionally collect an individual's IP address to help identify an individual, gather broad

                     the Sites.</span>
                   <br> <br>
                  How does Clothing Store collect this information- <br> <br>
                  <span class="box spd-col spd-pro">
                     We receive and store any information from your visits to our Sites or that you give us in any other
                     way. </span><br> <br>
                     <span class="box spd-rec spd-col">
                        As is true of most web sites, we gather and store certain information automatically, including
                        Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit
                        pages,
                        operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data.
                     </span> This information does not identify
                     individual users, and is used to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements
                     around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
                   <br> <br>
                  To do this, we use 'cookies' or alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard
                  drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features
                  such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. <span class="box pp-mar ptp-tra">
                     We use a third-party service provider
                     to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on the Sites.
                        This provider may collect
                        anonymous information about your visits to the Sites and may also use information about your visits to
                        this and other Web sites to refine our services.
                     
                  </span> If you are concerned about cookies, the "help",
                  "options" or "preferences" functions on most browsers will allow to limit or disable cookies
                  altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of our interactive features, and we
                  recommend that you leave them turned on. <br> <br>
                  Currently, our Sites do not respond to "Do Not Track" signals from your browser. <br> <br>
                  <span class="box pp-pro ptp-tra">
                     We may also collect anonymous information about your interactions with us through the use of pixel
                     tags (also called "web beacons" or "clear gifs"), which are tiny graphic images on the Sites and in
                     our emails. Pixel tags are now standard in the industry and help to us analyze our customers' online
                     behavior and measure the effectiveness of our Sites and our advertising. A third-party service
                     provider also helps us in our use of these tools.
                  </span> <br> <br>
                  To ensure we are sending our emails to the right address, we may receive a confirmation when you open
                  email from us if your computer supports such capabilities. <br> <br>
                  <span class="box spd-rec pp-dev">
                     Last, to provide customer service,
                     we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We
                     also sometimes receive address information from these sources to correct our records and deliver your
                     next purchase or communication more easily.
                  </span> <br> <br>
                  Any personal information that we collect will be stored in secure servers hosted in the U.S. or
                  Canada. We will correct such information whenever possible and delete stale information on an ongoing
                  basis and are very happy to hear from you to ensure that our information is as complete and accurate
                  as possible. <br> <br>

                     protection for personal information, and require that they not use it for other purposes.

                  How does Clothing Store keep your information secure- <br> <br>
                  Clothing Store is always striving to ensure you a safe and convenient online experience. This goes
                  beyond our technologies to include physical, contractual, and managerial safeguards to protect your
                  personal information. <br> <br>
                  We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Thawte Certified
                  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.<span class="box tpd-fin">
                      We reveal only the last
                     four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire
                     credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.
                  </span> <br> <br>
                  Security lies in your hands as well. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to
                  your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. In the
                  event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance
                  with its reporting rules and procedures. <br>
                  <br>What is "phishing"- <br> <br>
                  "Phishing" is a scam where fraudsters pretend that they represent well-known companies to steal your
                  personal information. If you receive an email claiming to be from Clothing Store that asks you for
                  your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card
                  information or other personal information through email. <br> <br>
                  How do I access or change my personal information- <br> <br>
                  You can access, add or update certain information in the " My Account" section of the Sites, including
                  order tracking and account information. When you update information, your old information is replaced
                  by your new information.

                  How can I control your use of my personal information- <br> <br>
                  We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive

                  How does Clothing Store protect kids'
                  privacy- <br> <br>
                  Clothing Store is concerned about the privacy and safety of children when they use the Internet. We
                  will never knowingly request personally identifiable information online from anyone under the age of
                  13 without prior verifiable parental consent. The Sites are general audience sites and are not
                  targeted to or intended for use by children. <br> <br>
                  To carry this promise through, we do not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's
                  products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use the Sites only with involvement of a
                  parent or guardian. <br> <br>
                  What about links to other web sites- <br> <br>
                  The Sites may contain links to third-party web sites. All such sites are independent from the Sites
                  and from Clothing Store. Clothing Store has no control over and expressly disclaims any liability for
                  such sites or their contents. Our links do not constitute an express or implied adoption or
                  endorsement of anything contained in the other sites. Any transactions that take place between you and
                  the third party are directly with the third party and Clothing Store will not be held responsible for
                  any loss or damage that you may incur as a consequence thereto.
                  Please read the privacy policies and terms and conditions posted on these other sites before using the
                  sites or disclosing any personal information to the sites. If you decide to access any of these sites,
                  you do so entirely at your own risk. <br> <br>
                  Your California Privacy Rights <br> <br>
                  California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of Clothing Store who are California residents
                  to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for
                  their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please reach out to our Privacy Officer. <br>
